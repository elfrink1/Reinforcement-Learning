    "## The Multi-armed bandit problem\n",
    "Imagine you're faced with a number of slot machines (also called 'bandits'), each with a lever ('arm') to pull. Upon pulling a particular lever, it will give a random reward from an unknown distribution particular to that lever. The goal of the multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem, is to maximise your total reward given that you are allowed to pull levers a fixed number of times total (this is called your 'budget').\n",
    "\n",
    "A basic strategy might be to spend some of your budget pulling different levers to get an idea of which levers give the most reward ('exploration'). After this, you may choose increasingly often pull the lever that you expect gives the most reward ('exploitation'). The question then is: how much exploration and how much exploitation makes the optimal strategy? This 'exploration-exploitation trade-off' is a classic feature of reinforcement learning problems: we have to interact with the environment to gather data, and we must choose an optimal way of interacting on the fly. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a MAB environment to interact with. Spend some time pulling levers to get a feeling for the problem (see cells below)."

    "The goal of this exercise is to get a feeling for this MAB problem. In order to do this, you're tasked with writing a strategy (policy) that maximises the expected reward, or - equivalently - mimises the expected regret (where the expectation is taken over multiple simulations where a new MAB is instantiated each time). Regret of a policy is defined here as: expected optimal reward - expected obtained reward. That is: it is the difference between how much reward an oracle that knows the optimal lever to pull would have obtained, and the reward the implemented policy obtains.\n",

    "Below a 'simulate_policies' function is provided that calculates this expected regret, given a policy (or list of policies for fair comparison of policies). A policy is a function that takes as input a state (in this case the tuple (arms_pulled, arms_rewards)), and outputs an action (in this case an integer in the interval [0, num_arms - 1] inclusive). Two example policies are provided: random, and a policy that starts random (we call this a burn-in period) and then proceeds to pull the lever it thinks is best based on the statistics gathered during the burn-in. \n",

See if you can write a policy that improves over this one. Note that to really evaluate this well we need to run simulations very often, which might be infeasible given the time we want to spend on this notebook.
